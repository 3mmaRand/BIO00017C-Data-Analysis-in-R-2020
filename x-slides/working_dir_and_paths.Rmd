# Introduction

## Aims

The aim of this section is to show you what is meant by a working directory and a path.

## Learning outcomes 

The successful student will be able to:

* find current working directory
* list files in their current working directory
* understand what is meant by working directory, absolute and relative paths


---
# Introduction

If you are very unfamiliar with these concepts you might want to start up RStudio and follow along. In which case...

`r emo::ji("clapper")` this is an instruction to do something

#  What is a working directory?


---
# What is a directory?

Directory is the old word for what many now call a folder `r emo::ji("folder")`.

It is commonly used in scientific computing. Commands that act on directories in most programming languages and environments reflect this.

For example, all of these mean "tell me my working directory":

* `getwd()` **get** **w**orking **d**irectory in R
* `pwd` **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory in Unix systems
* `os.getcwd()`  **get** **c**urrent **w**orking **d**irectory in Python

---
# What is a working directory?

The working directory is the default location a program is using. It is where the program will read and write files by default. You have only one working directory at a time.

The terms 'working directory', 'current working directory' and 'current directory' all mean the same thing.

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Find your current working directory with:
.scroll-output-width[
```{r}
getwd()
```
]

---
# What is a working directory?

If you do not like the working directory that R automatically chooses on starting up you can change it using the Tools menu

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Tools | Global Options. Then, under the General tab, edit the box labelled "Default working directory (when not in a project):".


---
# What is a working directory?

Your working directory *can* be the same as the location of the script file you are using ....

... but does not have to be.


--

## `r emo::ji("exclamation")` When using RStudio Projects the working directory is the Project directory.

#  What is a path?


---
# What is a path?

A path gives the address - or location - of a filesystem object, such as a file or directory.

Paths appear in the address bar of your browser or file explorer.

--

We need to know a file path whenever we want to read, write or refer to a file using code rather than interactively pointing and clicking to navigate.

--

A path can be **absolute** or **relative**

---

# Absolute paths

An Absolute path is given from the "root directory" of the object. 

The root directory of a file system is the first or top directory in the hierarchy.

For example, `C:\` or `M:\` on windows or `/` on a Mac which is displayed as Macintosh HD in Finder.

---
# Absolute paths

The absolute path for a file, `pigeon.txt` could be:  

* windows: `C:/Users/er13/Desktop/pigeons/data-raw/pigeon.txt`  <sup>1</sup>

.footnote[
.font60[
1. this appears as `C:\Users\er13\Desktop\pigeons\data-raw\pigeon.txt` in Windows Explorer because Microsoft DOS didn't have directories in 1981 when it was released. At the time it used the `/` character for 'switches' (instead of the existing convention `-` `r emo::ji("roll_eyes")`) so when it did start using directories it couldn't use `/`
]
]
--

* Mac/unix systems: `/Users/er13/Desktop/pigeons/data-raw/pigeon.txt`  


---
# Absolute paths

The absolute path for a file, `pigeon.txt` could be:  


* Or on the web:
`http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~er13/58M_BDS_2019/data-raw/pigeon.txt`  

---
# Relative paths

A relative path gives the location of a filesystem object *relative* to the working directory, (i.e., that returned by `getwd()`).

When `pigeon.txt` is in the working directory the relative path is just the file name:  `pigeon.txt`  

--

If there is a folder in the working directory called `data-raw` and `pigeon.txt` is inside that then the relative path is `data-raw/pigeon.txt`  

---
# Paths: moving up the hierarchy

`../` allows you to look in the directory above the working directory

When `pigeon.txt` is in folder above the working the relative path is `../pigeon.txt`  

--

And if it is in a folder called `data-raw` which is in the directory above the working directory then the relative path is `../data-raw/pigeon.txt`  

---
# What's in my directory?

You can list the contents of a directory using the `dir()` command

* `dir()` list the contents of the working directory
* `dir("..")` list the contents of the directory above the working directory
* `dir(../..)` list the contents of the directory two directories above the working directory
* `dir("data-raw")` list the contents of a folder call data-raw which is in the working directory.

---
# Relative or absolute

## `r emo::ji("exclamation")` Most of the time you should use relative paths because that makes your work portable.

--

You only need to use absolute paths when you are referring to filesystem outside the one you are using.

# Example

---
# Example

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Download and unzip [pigeons.zip](../pigeons.zip) which has the following structure:
.code80[
```
-- pigeons
   |__data-processed
      |__pigeon_long.txt
   |__data-raw
      |__pigeon.txt
   |__figures
      |__fig1.tiff
   |__scripts
      |__analysis.R
      |__import_reshape.R
   |__pigeons.Rproj
```
]
---
# Example

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Open the two script files check you can alter the paths for file import and export commands if you set your working directory to
   * `pigeons`
   * `scripts`
   * the directory above `pigeons` on your set up
   * the directory two directories above `pigeons` on your set up
